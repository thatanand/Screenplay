# Screenplay
A minimalist scriptwriting web application, designed and developed by myself and [Faheem](https://twitter.com/faheempatel).

The idea is simple — to create a very easy-to-use tool for any budding/experienced scriptwriter. Having explored various existing solutions, Screenplay aims to combine best of all worlds with an intuitive web-app (*plus I'm kinda hoping that someone like Aaron Sorkin uses this*).
